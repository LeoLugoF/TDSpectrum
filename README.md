# TDSpectrum
Plots a UV-Vis spectrum from a gaussian output or saves only the data.

Maybe you are like me and don't like the plots made by Gaussview or chemcraft. So your best option is to store the x, y data and make a plot for yourself. 

This program will allow you to calculate your own spectra with a custom sigma value to match your UV-Vis spectra with the experimental ones!
